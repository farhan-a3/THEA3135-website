      <h3>Step 1: My Description (under 100 words)</h3>
      <p>
        The image is a McDonald's poster ad that depicts a Big Mac in the bottom middle on a black background. Above the Big Mac, the slogan says "the only known cure for a BIG MAC ATTACK" with the word "ATTACK" being repeated several times vertically in different colours, going behind the burger in transparent layered typography. The burger looks edited with glossy buns and ingredients stacked perfectly with no flaws. The lighting is dramatic and staged. It also looks digitally retouched and color enhanced, making the burger seem more polished and appealing than it would in real life.

      <h3>AI Description</h3>
      <p>
        The image is a vintage-style poster advertisement for McDonald’s, centered on a Big Mac burger and designed with dramatic, high-contrast visuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the very top, the yellow McDonald’s “Golden Arches” logo appears against a solid black background, with the word “McDonald’s” written in white beneath it. The black backdrop continues through most of the poster, creating a dark, theatrical setting that makes the text and burger stand out sharply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below the logo, a bold white slogan reads: “the only known cure for a BIG MAC ATTACK”
      </p>
      <p>
        The phrase “BIG MAC” is in large white block letters, heavier and more prominent than the rest of the sentence, drawing immediate attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under that, the word “ATTACK” is repeated multiple times vertically. Each repetition is in a different bright color, including pink, red, orange, yellow, and pale blue. The words appear layered and slightly blurred behind each other, creating a motion or echo effect. This stacked typography sits behind the burger image, partially obscured by it, giving the layout depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the bottom center sits the Big Mac itself, photographed in a glossy, highly stylized way:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The sesame seed bun is shiny and evenly browned</li>
        <li>Two beef patties are visible</li>
        <li>A middle bun layer separates them</li>
        <li>Melted cheese slices peek out from the sides</li>
        <li>Shredded lettuce and pickles are tucked between layers</li>
        <li>The sauce looks creamy and slightly dripping</li>
        <li>Small diced onions are visible on the top patty</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The burger looks carefully assembled, symmetrical, and idealized, clearly retouched for advertising. Lighting is dramatic, with highlights on the bun and meat that give it a polished, almost glowing appearance against the dark background.
      </p>
      <p>
        A white border frames the entire poster, reinforcing the print-ad look. At the very bottom edge, small print text appears, including copyright and production details indicating McDonald’s System, Inc., along with a 1976 date and printing information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the composition uses contrast, layered typography, and saturated color to dramatize the idea of craving, presenting the Big Mac as the “cure” to a humorous, exaggerated “attack.”

      <h3>Step 4: Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        The two recreations line up on the big idea: dark background, a Big Mac sitting low and centered, and the word “ATTACK” stacked in loud colors to make the “craving” joke feel intense. But they split fast once you look at what each description paid attention to. The image generated from my shorter description feels like a modern ad, super clean gradients, crisp typography, and a glossy, “perfect” burger, but it drops a lot of the vintage poster vibe (no print border, no little production details, branding gets simplified). The image generated from the AI’s longer description brings back more of the original layout and context, like the framed border and stronger McDonald’s branding at the top, because the prompt basically told it “this is a vintage print ad.” It made me notice how descriptions don’t record reality, they choose priorities. Whatever gets named becomes the “truth” of the image, and whatever gets skipped kind of evaporates.
