      <h3>Part 1: Opening paragraph</h3>
      <p>
        Undergraduate students (18+) and recent grads are invited to CTRL+HACK+DEL 2.0, a 36-hour, in-person hackathon taking place <strong>February 13-15, 2026</strong> at <strong>York University Markham Campus</strong>, where participants team up to build and demo new projects with support from mentors, workshops, and sponsors from the Major League Hacking season. Registration is open online, and because it's free (with food and on-site support provided), it's a straightforward chance to meet people outside your program, build something you can actually show, and leave the weekend with a finished project instead of another half-started idea. The event runs across those dates, with the detailed schedule and exact start time shared by the organizers closer to the weekend, so anyone interested should register early and watch for updates.
